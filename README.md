# Introduction
The goal of this project is to understand the Data Analyst job market. Specifically, looking at what are the top-paying jobs, in-demand skills, and where high demand meets high salary. In addition, I focused mostly on remote roles as that is the sector I am invested in.
# Background
Yearning to learn more about the industry and job market I am in, this project was made to streamline what skills are valuable. This is broken down into top-paid, in-demand, and both if applicable. This allows me and others to streamline the learning process to narrow the scope for advancing in the Data Analyst career.

The data is provided by [Luke Barousse's SQL for Data Analytics Course](https://www.lukebarousse.com/sql). Luke is a talented Data Analyst who has put together a tool to gather data centered around a multitude of data based jobs. The CSV data files used for this analysis can be found on his website.

### The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries:
1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

# Tools
For my insights on the data analyst job market, I utilized multiple key tools:
- SQL: The main basis of my analysis utilized SQL to query from the database and highlight key information to answer my questions.
- PostgreSQL: The chosen database management system. It is reliable, open source, and quick to learn.
- Visual Studio Code: My bread and butter for executing and managing SQL queries.
- Git & GitHub: Essential for documentation and ease of sharing for both my analysis and the queries that went into them.
