# Introduction
This project was to understand the Data Analyst job market. Specifically looking at what are the top-paying jobs, in-demand skills, and where high demand meets high salary. In addition, I focused mostly on remote roles as that is the sector I am personally focused on being in. Though the datasets used for this analysis could be broken out into non-remote jobs or focus on specific cities or locations.
